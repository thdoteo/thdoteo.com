Hello. First of all, welcome to my website. My name is Theo and my pseudonym is thdoteo. I am 20 years old and I live in Paris, France. I am a computer science enthusiast who have a tons of project ideas. Currently, I am pursuing a master degree in this field.


My journey to computer science
I have always been interested in science and especially in new technologies. As a child, I wanted to build my own robot by playing around with a Mindstorms kit from Lego. Seeing my code running and interacting with real life motivated me. Thereby, for about 10 years my passion is programming on computers. I learnt with some books from a french community of developers, the SiteDuZero, now known as OpenClassrooms.

Since then, I experienced the creation of games, mobile and desktop applications. I discovered Linux, built my own computer and started to host my services on a dedicated server. Nowadays, I am still learning new technologies because being versatile is important for me. Since I started studying in a computer engineering school, I feel more involved in complex computer science concepts. One of our recent project was to create a software able to extract text from an image. Using a low level programing languages, understanding how a neural network is made and solving a real life problem inspired me.

As I was starting to work on many different projects, I created this website. Its aim is to present every one of them, from unfinished prototypes to complete significant projects.




Some other interests
Spending time far away from a screen has helped me solving many bugs... This is one of the reason why I like spending time in Britanny, France. I go there to be on the coast and be able to do what I love, sailing. During the summer holidays I work as a sailing instructor and teach small groups how to windsurf.
Otherwise, I had the opportunity to travel to many countries around the world. Such as the USA, England, Mexico, Cuba, Ireland, Morocco, Egypt, Senegal, Jordan, Italy, Spain and some others. It has always been a particular and instructive experience.




See you later
Many of my projects are open source as I enjoy contributing with other people. Thus, do not hesitate look at them and maybe fork them. Moreover, I would be glad to answer your questions and maybe start working with you.
